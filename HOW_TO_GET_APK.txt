How to get an APK (two options)

1) Build locally (recommended)
- Install Android Studio (Electric Eel or later) and Android SDK platforms/tools for API 34.
- Open the project folder `app` in Android Studio (File → Open).
- Let Gradle sync. You may need to update Kotlin/Compose plugin if your Android Studio is newer.
- Run: Build → Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) → Build APK(s).
- The debug APK will be at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

2) Let GitHub Actions build it automatically (no local setup)
- Push the project to a GitHub repository (private or public).
- Ensure the workflow `.github/workflows/android-build.yml` exists (it's included).
- On push to `main` or `master`, GitHub Actions will run and produce an artifact `app-debug-apk`.
- You can download the artifact from the workflow run page under Actions → the run → Artifacts.

Notes:
- The generated APK is a debug-signed APK (Android debug key). It's fine for installation on devices for testing.
- If you want a release-signed APK (for Play Store or distribution), you'll need to provide a signing keystore and update `app/build.gradle` signingConfigs, and adjust the GitHub Actions workflow to use secrets for the keystore and passwords.
- If you want, I can add the signing CI steps (store keystore as GitHub secret and sign release build).

If you want, I can also try to produce the debug APK here — but this environment doesn't have Android SDK/Gradle toolchain installed, so I can't build it directly. The CI workflow I added will build automatically on GitHub after you push the repo.
